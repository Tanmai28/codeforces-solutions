 **Gravity Flip**


ðŸ§  **Problem Intuition:**

Think of the toy box as a row of vertical columns of cubes. Initially, cubes are stacked vertically under normal gravity (pulling down). When gravity switches to the right, cubes slide horizontally, collecting in the rightmost columns.

Chris wants to know: What do the column heights look like after the cubes settle rightward?

When gravity pulls to the right, itâ€™s equivalent to sorting the columns in non-decreasing order. Why? 

**Because cubes slide from taller columns to shorter ones, eventually balancing in ascending order from left to right.**
